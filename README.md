Developed an assembly language encoder program for Linux that reads input from a file or stdin and outputs to a file or stdout, encoding characters by incrementing their value. The program handles command-line arguments for specifying input and output files, and prints debug information for all command-line arguments. Using system calls exclusively, it demonstrates basic encoding functionality and file manipulation in a low-level programming environment.
